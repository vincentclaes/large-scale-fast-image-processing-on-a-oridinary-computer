# Large Scale Fast Image Processing on an Ordinary Computer

This notebook show you how to speed up dramatically your image processing thanks to Huggingface Datasets and Arrow.
We generate 10K images of 512\*512 RGB pixels with a total size of 7.5 GB and resize them to 30\*30 pixels in just above 2 minutes.

- More info on the tools, and gotcha's in the notebook [large-scale-fast-image-processing-on-an-ordinary-computer.ipynb](large-scale-fast-image-processing-on-an-ordinary-computer.ipynb)
